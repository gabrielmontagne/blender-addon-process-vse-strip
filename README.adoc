== Overview

This addon enables a 'Process Clip' operator and panel that works on image strips from the VSE.

It works by POSTing, for each image in the image strip,  to a locally running server, by default 0.0.0.0:3000/process a payload that has, among other things, the original_file_name.
With this, that server (not implemented here) can open the file as a NumPy array, process it, save it to a new path, and return the path to the new filename.

This addon will create a new image strip from the returned processed image paths.

image::before.png[Before]

image::operator.png[Operator]

image::after.png[After]

== Animation curves

The addon will forward all animated custom properties on the scene that start with xyy_.  You can use these animation curves to parametrize the transformation of the frames.

== Helpers

We have a couple of helper functions on https://github.com/gabrielmontagne/xyy to make this simple.

You can find a minimalistic implementation of a module that uses these functions here:  https://github.com/gabrielmontagne/process_vse_sort.
