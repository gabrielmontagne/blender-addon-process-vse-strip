========================================

0.0.1,

This addon enables a 'Process Clip' operator and panel that works on image strips from the VSE.
It will import the module from the name provided in the dialog and will pass each of the images as numpy arrays to a `process_frame` method on it.
It expects, as return value, another numpy array for which this addon will create a new file that will be attached to a new strip with the processed files.

This addon uses scipy and numpy, etc. and your scripts modules, whatever they use, must be visible from Blender.
